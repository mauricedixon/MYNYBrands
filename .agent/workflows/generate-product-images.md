- **Back View**: Additional graffiti characters and design
- **Detail View**: Closeup of hand-painted artwork quality

### 3. MYNY Snapback ($150)

## Image Style Requirements
- Pure white studio background
- Floating ghost mannequin effect (no poles/stands)
- Photorealistic e-commerce photography
- High-end luxury streetwear aesthetic (like Farfetch/SSENSE)

## After Generation

2. Update `src/data/products.ts` with new image paths
3. Test on http://localhost:3000
